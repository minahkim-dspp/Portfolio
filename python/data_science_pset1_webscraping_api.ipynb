    "- collectionId: I consider collectionID a discrete, qualitative, and nominal variable. According to the textbook, a data attribute is discrete when the data can be \"finite or countably infinite set of value\" (Tan et al., 2019, p.52) Although the collectionID is written in a float type, no single collectionId has a decimal point. (Check the first code block below.) Furthermore, the all collectionId in the 25% and 75% range has 9 digit number beginning with 7. (Check the second code block below.) I believe that we can infer from this distribution that there are specific range of numbers allocated for collectionId. Hence, I consider its data attribute to discrete. Moreover, a collectionId is qualitative because applying numerical calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) does not give us any information. In fact, based on the given information, I cannot make any inference from a collectionId of a song being one unit higher than that of another song. Thus the collectionId is a qualitative and nominal variable, which the order does not bear any meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- trackPrice: trackPrice is a continuous, quantitative, and ratio type of variable. I believe trackPrice is a continuous variable because of two reasons. One, it represents a value that does not exist discontinuously, which is monetary value. Similar to the flow of water, monetary value can be measured by a tool that creates discrete values but is continuous by nature. Two, the trackPrice variable is in a float type object, a numerical type that allows more flexibility than the integer type. In fact, they are values with decimal numbers, such as 12.99 and 1.29. Thus, I will argue that trackPrice is continuous. TrackPrice is also quantitative because we can derive meaningful inferences from numerical calculations. In the textbook, 'both differences and ratio' give meaningful results for the ratio type variable (Tan et al., 2019, p.50). We can know that a song is $1.00 expensive if the trackPrice is 1 bigger than that of another song. We also can know that the price is twice expensive when the trackPrice is twice higher for one song compared to another. Therefore, the attribute of trackPrice fits with the description of the quantitive ratio type. \n",
    "\n",
    "- trackTimeMillis: I classify trackTimeMills as a continuous, quantitative, and ratio type variable. Similar to trackPrice, trackTimeMillis represents a continuous value that humans can only capture using limiting observation tools - time. It is true that the trackTimeMillis records everything in milliseconds without using any decimals. Yet, when the measuring unit is small as a millisecond (and when we are not in a science lab), this phenomenon seems to happen only because of the limitation of the measuring tool rather than the intent of creating the variable. Thus, I perceive it as a continuous variable. I again view it as a quantitative, ratio type variable because it will give us a meaningful insight when we add, subtract, multiply, or divide among the value in the trackTimeMills column.\n",
    "\n",
    "- primaryGenreName: This is a discrete, qualitative, nominal variable. The primaryGenreName is composed of words that describe the genre, so its variation is finite by nature. (Check the third code block to see the list of words used in the dataset.) It is qualitative because we cannot interpret from -- nor apply -- the mathematical calculations in this column without any manipulation. It is also nominal because the genres do not have any relative order from each other by nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "- contentAdvisoryRating: This is a discrete, qualitative, ordinal variable. There is only a few values that the contentAdvisoryRating can have because the US content advisory system has a specific number of levels, such as R and NR. I also consider it qualitative, as no mathematical calculation using the raw string data can give any significant insight. However, I think it is an ordinal variable because each level has an order based on the level of violence or inappropriateness to children. For instance, NR clearly comes before R when we order based on how young someone can consume the material without parental guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- isStreamable: This is a binary, qualitative, nominal variable. isStreamable is a boolean variable that only allows True or False values. Thus, it fits the definition of a binary variable, which is to allow only two values. I perceive it to be qualitative because we cannot conduct any mathematical calculation without converting the boolean to a numerical variable. Finally, I conclude that it is a nominal variable as True and False do not have an innate order between them. "

If the identification number takes the role of the first case, it will help us understand the distribution of the observations or distinguish existing data from the generated data (possibly through prediction). For the second case, the identification number or the information derived from it will be considered like any other parameter. However, I  acknowledge that the identification number only takes roles in any of these roles when the context makes it suitable."
