## Introduction 
**Welcome to my repository!**

My name is MinAh Kim, a Master of Science candidate in Data Science for Public Policy. 

This repository contains the overview of my projects in school using Python and R. If you are interested in my project in work or class work not in this repository, please feel free to reach out to me via minahkim.official@gmail.com.

You can check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/minah-kim/) for my most recent work update. There is also a copy of my resume in my [blog](https://minahkim.georgetown.domains/resume-cv/)
  
## Navigating the Repository
This repository includes my final projects in class and the problem sets.
  
### Predicting the Rice Yield of Sub-Saharan African Farmers Using the Performance Indicators for Sustainable Farming
A final project for Data Science II (Spring 2023). This class covers supervised machine learning techniques. The final jupyter notebook file and the white paper are under `predicting_grain_yield_sustainable_farming_pi` folder. For a short summary, please check my [blog post](https://minahkim.georgetown.domains/elementor-547/).

### Does Humanitarian Aid in Education Increase Government Spending in Education in Low/Lower Income Countries?
A final project for Accelerated Statistics for Public Policy (Fall 2022). This class went over the basic concepts of statistics and regression. **I later took classes that studied RCT, RD, Difference-in-difference, and Instrumental Variables**. If you want to know more about my later coursework, please let me know. Since it was a group project, the `humanitarian_aid_gov_spending` only included a presentation that I generated for our group. For a short summary, please check my [blog post](https://minahkim.georgetown.domains/321-2/).

### Asthma Prevalence and Toxic Released in the Air
A final project for Data Science I (Fall 2022). This class covers data wrangling basics and the text analysis introduction. I later studied text analysis more deeply in the Data Science III course in Spring 2023. Again, please feel free to reach out for further information. In this project, I did some geospatial analysis using Geopandas. My work is in the `airquality_asthma` folder. For a short summary, please check my [blog post](https://minahkim.georgetown.domains/air-qualiasthmaair-quality/).

### Python problem set / R problem set / Data visualization
These are the folders for problem sets and data visualization created in png within the process. I tried to include the course name and the topic in the title of the jupyter notebook or a Rmarkdown file.
